Installation:

To complete the import process you have to import a subpackage which depends on your SRP version. To know your SRP version, inside Unity Editor, go to Window > Package Manager.
Within the Package Manager window, set the packages filter to "In Project". You will now see your current SRP module and version, for example "Lightweight RP    6.9.0" or "Universal RP    10.2.2".
The unitypackage to install according to your SRP version goes as follows:

LWRP (any version): "Tessellation & Displacement vX.X.X - LWRP"
URP 7.1.8 - 9.0.0: "Tessellation & Displacement vX.X.X - URP 7.1.8+"
URP 10.1.0+: "Tessellation & Displacement vX.X.X - URP 10.1.0+"
